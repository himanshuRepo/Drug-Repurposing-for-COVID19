# Drug-Repurposing-for-COVID19
Drug Repurposing using Traditional Medicines for SAMHAR-COVID19 Hackathon 

Naturally obtained phytochemicals, have been used in various lung ailments for a long time. We intend to develop a working prototype which will use AI based learning models to isolate molecules with probable  efficacy against the SARS-COV2.

## Achievable outcomes:
1. Molecules with the highest affinitys score
2. List out all possible combinations/individual molecules for possible treatment of Covid-19.

Following steps will be followed to achieve the above outcomes:
1. Collection of set of sample naturally occuring molecules. 
2. As there are numerouos combinations possible for activity against the target site, trying out each combination is a tidious task.
3. To fasten the same, possible combinations of these molecules will be explored using optimization algorithms like genetic algo. 
4. In-silico assay of these combinations along with individual molecules will be performed using softwares such as PyRx, to measure the binding affinity of these molecule/s
